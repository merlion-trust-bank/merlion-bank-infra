# ADR-006: Deploy in us-east-1 instead of ap-southeast-1

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-25
- **Deciders:** Solutions Architect (with instructor approval)
- **Related:** HC-1 Data residency (docs/requirements.md), assumption A-1

## Context
The Merlion Trust Bank use case (HC-1) requires all customer data, backups and application logs
to remain at rest in `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore). Our instructor has directed the class to deploy
in **`us-east-1`** (course AWS account, shared tooling and budget are set up there).

The intent of HC-1 is **data residency**: customer data must not spread across regions or to
third-party SaaS in other jurisdictions. That intent can be met in any single approved region.

## Decision
- Deploy everything in **`us-east-1`**, using two Availability Zones (`us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`).
- Treat HC-1 as **"all customer data, backups and logs stay in one approved region"**, with
  `us-east-1` as the approved region for this course.
- The region is a **single Terraform variable** (`var.region`) with a validation rule that rejects
  any other value. Changing region is a one-line change plus a redeploy.
- No cross-region replication: RDS automated backups and snapshots stay in-region; S3 buckets have
  no cross-region replication; Loki log storage uses an S3 bucket in the same region.
- No SaaS component stores customer data or logs (observability is self-hosted; see ADR-003).

## Alternatives considered
| Option | Why not chosen |
|---|---|
| Deploy in `ap-southeast-1` as the brief states | Conflicts with the instructor directive and the course account setup |
| Split: data in `ap-southeast-1`, compute in `us-east-1` | Cross-region traffic and latency; data would still be processed outside the residency region; more cost and complexity |

## Consequences
**Positive**
- Matches the course environment; no cross-account or cross-region workarounds.
- Residency is still enforced: one region, validated in code, no replication, no SaaS log storage.
- Moving to Singapore later needs only `var.region` changed (plus AZ names) and a redeploy.

**Negative / risks**
- Strictly, the brief's literal constraint (Singapore) is not met. Mitigation: this ADR records the
  deviation and approval; the compliance mapping (DOC-04) shows the single-region evidence.
- `us-east-1` is a busy region, and some services launch there first. No impact on this design.
- AZ names are region-specific and must be updated if the region changes.

## Evidence
- `bootstrap/variables.tf`: `region` defaults to `us-east-1`, with a validation rule
- State bucket `kean-merlion-tfstate-255945442255`: `get-bucket-location` returns `null` (= us-east-1)
